double	 	 double	 double
float	 	 float	 float
int32	Uses variable-length encoding. Inefficient for encoding negative numbers – if your field is likely to have negative values, use sint32 instead.	 int32	 int
int64	Uses variable-length encoding. Inefficient for encoding negative numbers – if your field is likely to have negative values, use sint64 instead.	 int64	 long
uint32	Uses variable-length encoding.	 uint32	 int
uint64	Uses variable-length encoding.	 uint64	 long
sint32	Uses variable-length encoding. Signed int value. These more efficiently encode negative numbers than regular int32s.	 int32	 int
sint64	Uses variable-length encoding. Signed int value. These more efficiently encode negative numbers than regular int64s. 	 int64	 long
fixed32	Always four bytes. More efficient than uint32 if values are often greater than 228. 	 uint32	 int
fixed64	Always eight bytes. More efficient than uint64 if values are often greater than 256.	 uint64	 long
sfixed32	Always four bytes.	 int32	 int
sfixed64	Always eight bytes.	 int64	 long
bool	 	 bool	 boolean
string	A string must always contain UTF-8 encoded or 7-bit ASCII text.	 string	 String
bytes	May contain any arbitrary sequence of bytes.	string	ByteString
